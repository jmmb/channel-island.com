**Miles Island** is a music project from Minneapolis songwriter and
multi-instrumentalist Jim Bjorklun. The sound evokes these solitary winters and
hazy summers of Minnesota.

It began years earlier, when Jim was living on a lake and playing in various
bands. He started feeling the need to create music as well, and gradually
collected a string of song ideas and lyrics.

Jim then set up in a glitchy mid-1990s recording studio, and began to
experiment. But after some
[initial efforts](https://store.jamesland.net/album/after-the-fact){:target="_blank"},
he perceived the need to start again. Instead of just climbing a tree, this
music should also reach for certain branches.

So with a handful of guiding principles, and a growing knack for mixing and
producing, Jim dug in again with a new sense of purpose.

When the dust finally settled, there were 13 finished tracks. The result is a
mix of alternative rock and dance music, as refracted through the lens of
psychedelic pop.

Ten of these songs became the debut album
“[Right As Rain](https://miles1sland.bandcamp.com/album/right-as-rain)”,
which was released June 21, 2019. It's a highly personal record, reflecting the
peaks and valleys of a precarious time.

On June 26, 2020, two more songs from this initial batch were polished and
released as the standalone single
"[Who Are You?](https://miles1sland.bandcamp.com/album/who-are-you-single)".
